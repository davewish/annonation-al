# Getting Started with Create React App – ADAS Learning Project

This project was bootstrapped with **[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app?utm_source=chatgpt.com).**

I am currently using this project to  **learn about Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS)** , specifically:

* **Labeling and annotating driving data** (images, videos, sensor data).
* **Connecting annotated data to AI agent models** for perception and decision-making tasks.
* Understanding how  **ADAS pipelines** integrate with AI systems.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.
Open  [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

---

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
See the section about **[running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests?utm_source=chatgpt.com)** for more information.

---

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the** **`build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and filenames include hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See **[deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment?utm_source=chatgpt.com)** for details.

---

### `npm run eject`

**Warning:** this is a one-way operation. Once you`eject`, you cannot go back!

This command copies all configuration files and dependencies into your project for full control (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.).

You don’t have to use it unless you want to **customize the build process** .

## Learn More – ADAS & AI Focus

You can learn more in the **[Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started?utm_source=chatgpt.com).**

To learn React, check out the** **[React documentation](https://reactjs.org/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).**

For this project, I am focusing on:

* **Labeling & annotating sensor and video data** for autonomous driving.
* **Connecting annotated datasets to AI models** for tasks such as lane detection, object recognition, and ADAS decision-making.
* **Experimenting with AI agents** to simulate and test ADAS scenarios.
